            <b> What Temp-Number apps and website do </b>
            <br></br>
            Temp-Number service provides temporary disposable phone numbers that may be used on different websites and services, avoiding exposing the real phone number. The numbers are good for short usage (up to 20 minutes) and may receive only SMS messages. The
            user should choose the exact pair of the service name and country and will be charged if the number received the message. <br></br>

            <b>Information We Collect and Why</b><br></br>
